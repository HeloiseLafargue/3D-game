# Drift Fury - 3D Game Development

## Description
"Drift Fury" is an ambitious project crafted for the Computer Graphics course as part of the Computer Engineering program at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid. The focus of this project is to explore the extensive capabilities of Visual Studio for developing a three-dimensional game. By delving into game design and development, "Drift Fury" serves as both an educational exercise and a demonstration of the practical application of computer graphics principles.

### Requisites
- Visual Studio with C++ development tools
- Graphics library compatible with Visual Studio (e.g., DirectX, OpenGL, SDL)
- A system capable of compiling and running vcxproj projects

## Development
During the "Computer Graphics" course, "Drift Fury" was meticulously developed to provide insight into the multifaceted nature of 3D game creation. Leveraging the powerful integrated development environment (IDE) provided by Visual Studio, the team has crafted a game that not only entertains but also exemplifies the technical aspects of computer graphics, physics simulation, and user interface design in gaming.
